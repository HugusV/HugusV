# Machine Learning Mind Map (proposed by ChatGPT)

## 1. Machine Learning Overview
   - **Definition**: Machine learning is a subset of AI where computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
   - **Goal**: Make predictions or decisions based on data.

## 2. Types of Machine Learning
   - **Supervised Learning**
     - Uses labeled data
     - **Examples**: Classification, Regression
     - **Algorithms**:
       - Linear Regression
       - Decision Trees
       - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - **Unsupervised Learning**
     - Uses unlabeled data
     - **Examples**: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
     - **Algorithms**:
       - K-means
       - PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
   - **Reinforcement Learning**
     - Learns through trial and error
     - **Examples**: Game AI, Robotics
     - **Key Concepts**:
       - Agent
       - Reward System
       - Exploration vs Exploitation

## 3. Key Concepts
   - **Training**: Teaching the model with data.
   - **Testing**: Evaluating the model with unseen data.
   - **Model**: The mathematical representation of the learned system.
   - **Features**: Input variables used to make predictions.
   - **Labels**: Output variables or the target data.
   - **Overfitting**: Model performs well on training data but poorly on testing data.
   - **Underfitting**: Model performs poorly on both training and testing data.

## 4. Common Algorithms
   - **Linear Regression**: Predicts a continuous output based on input features.
   - **Logistic Regression**: Predicts probabilities for classification tasks.
   - **Decision Trees**: Breaks down data by making decisions based on features.
   - **Neural Networks**: Mimics the human brain with layers of interconnected "neurons."

## 5. Tools & Libraries
   - **Python Libraries**:
     - Scikit-learn
     - TensorFlow
     - Keras
     - PyTorch
   - **Development Environments**:
     - Jupyter Notebooks
     - Google Colab
     - AWS SageMaker

## 6. Applications
   - **Healthcare**: Disease prediction, drug discovery.
   - **Finance**: Stock price prediction, fraud detection.
   - **Marketing**: Customer segmentation, recommendation systems.
   - **Autonomous Systems**: Self-driving cars, drones.
